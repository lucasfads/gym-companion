# Gym Companion

Gym Companion is my first project developed from scratch to practice React.

This webapp helps users track their workout programs and exercise load progress, with the added feature of visualizing this progress through charts.

Since it's only for practing React, there's no real database. Instead, I decided to use [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API).

## Built with:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (kinda)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)


## Requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v21 or higher)


## Running it

To run Gym Companion locally for development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required npm packages:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Once the installation is complete, start the application in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will lauch the app in development mode, ready for use and exploration.
